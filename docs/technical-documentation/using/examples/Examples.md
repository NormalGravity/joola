## Part of the joola.io repo:
These examples can be found under `lib/webserver/public/examples`.

#### Clean Slate
This example loads the joola.io SDK, but does nothing more than that. It gives you the ability to use the Developer Console to 
 operate the framework.
 
#### MouseMove
This is a complete example showing how you can push events (every time you move the mouse) and then query and visualize these events.

#### BitCoin BlockChain
The BlockChain example connects to the blockchain stream and visualize transactions as they arrive.
