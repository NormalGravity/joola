joola.io is an extensive framework and in order to allow rapid development and easier introduction to code, 
we have broken it down to several subsystems, each addressing a different aspect of the framework.

- [Core](Subsystem-core) - Internal processes
- [Common](Subsystem-common) - Shared modules and code
- [Dispatch](Subsystem-dispatch) - The grid messaging system
- [Query](Subsystem-query) - Manages the aspects of querying the system
- [Beacon](The-Beacon-Subsystem) - Handles the framework's internal cache
- [Authentication](Subsystem-auth) - All authentication aspects of the framework
- [Web Server](Subsystem-webserver) - Serves web content to end users
- [SDK](Subsystem-sdk) - Used to communicate with joola.io framework and manage it
