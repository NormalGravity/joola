## Subsystems
We've tried to keep things simple and divided the framework into the listed logical entities, each is aimed at serving a different aspect of the framework.

- [Core](Subsystem-core) - Internal processes
- [Common](Subsystem-common) - Shared modules and code
- [Dispatch](The-Dispatch-Subsystem) - The grid messaging system
- [Query](Subsystem-query) - Manages the aspects of querying the system
- [Beacon](The-Beacon-Subsystem) - Handles the framework's internal cache
- [Authentication](Subsystem-auth) - All authentication aspects of the framework
- [Web Server](Subsystem-webserver) - Serves web content to end users
- [SDK](The-SDK-Subsystem) - Used to communicate with joola.io framework and manage it

## The development process
We aim to create the world's best mass-scale data analytics framework and for that, we need to have a solid and robust development process.
This section describes the process and protocols we use throughout the development of the framework.

## Code documentation
This wiki also includes a [_jsdoc_ section](code-documentation), in which code comments are taken directly from the source and published to the wiki in a formatted manner.
