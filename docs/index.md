Joola allows you to focus on developing your product and what you do best while not needing to worry about developing a full scale data analytics solution for your users.

Push events of any type (visits, registrations, purchases, game play and more...) to Joola using a simple JSON format and then, using the SDK or REST API, explore and visualize your data.
