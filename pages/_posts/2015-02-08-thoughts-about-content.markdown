I think this is maybe the 5 time I'm building a site for this project. 
While the technical aspects of publishing a website gets refined with every iteration, it's dealing with the actual content that I struggle most with, this part does not get easier.
  
With previous times my focus was on getting all the technical details to the reader, for them to be able to use the software as quickly as possible.
The thing I left out was actually explaining what Joola does and how it can bring value to their specific use case. 
I think that this iteration will focus more on the "product" than the specific technical aspects needed from the user, the assumption is that if you'll care to learn more about Joola you'll simply navigate your way. 
A safe assumption. It's sounds like a simple understanding, however for me, as simple as it was, it eludes me.
