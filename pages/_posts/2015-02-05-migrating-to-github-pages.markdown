That's it, I've decided to move to GitHub pages to host JoolaJS' content. Up until now we've had several different outlets, all maintained at different levels: website, documentation site (under readme.io), Wiki, API documentation (under apiary) and more.

Maintaining an open-source project is a difficult task, but maintaining its content can be even more, so we're simplifying things. We aim to keep things short and to point, I guess both users and us will have a better experience as a result.

We're now in the process of migration, so things will be a bit "in the air" for a couple of weeks until we finish with the migration. Code and features are not expected to change as part of this move and we'll keep you updated in this space about our progress.
